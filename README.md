# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on Sales Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a multi-month sales dataset. The main objective is to clean raw sales data, engineer useful features, and extract meaningful business insights using data analysis and visualization techniques.
The analysis is implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, following a clear and structured workflow.


### 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

- Real-world data cleaning
- Feature engineering from raw columns
- Grouping and aggregation for analysis
- Insightful data visualizations
- End-to-end EDA process suitable for beginners to intermediate learners


#### 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas – for data manipulation
- NumPy – for numerical operations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook


The cleaned dataset is grouped to answer analytical questions such as:
- Which month had the highest sales?
- Which products sold the most?
- Sales trends over time
